<h1> Description </h1>
<p> Within this challenge I was able to use skills learned in class like math.floor, console.log, alert, functions and if functions, and variables. I had trouble understanding variables and how they relate and help with coding in general. Now I have a clear understanding. The goal was to successfully get a password generator to work and correctly provide the user a password with their desired length. </p>

<h1> Knowledge </h1>
<p> I used my knowledge of Javascript, math floor, math random, variables, arrays, if statements. I also used outside resources like https://www.tutorialstonight.com/password-generator-in-javascript to see how mathfloor, arrays worked. I also used MDN for help on .concat, return, alert, and query selector. </p>
